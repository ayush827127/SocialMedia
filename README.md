# Running a Vite Project Locally

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run a Vite project on your local device.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Comes with Node.js installation.
- Git: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the Vite project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the Vite project repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open your terminal and change your current directory to the cloned project directory.

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<project_directory>` with the path to the cloned project directory.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install project dependencies using npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Vite project using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server, compiles the project, and opens it in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the project files will be automatically detected and the browser will reload accordingly.

## Accessing the Project

Once the project is running, you can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Additional Commands

- **Build for Production:** To build the project for production, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command generates a production-ready build of the project in the `dist` directory.

- **Linting:** To lint the project files, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

    This command checks your code for potential errors and style inconsistencies.
